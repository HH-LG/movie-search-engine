                                　　Emmy Award-winning cinematographer David Hannan has filmed for 7 years to create this magnificent testimony to our extraordinary undersea world, set to an original score by Tania Rose.  We meet thousands of reef inhabitants, from ancient turtles to feeding sharks, adorable pygmy seahorses and savage sea slugs, witness a manta ray ballet and courting octopus.  Specialized state-of-the-art High Definition technology captures these lives with unprecedented intimacy, illustrating elaborate courtship displays, mating rituals, feeding frenzies, intense night-time predation, cannibalism and chemical warfare.
                                    
                                　　David Hannan is renowned not only for his filmmaking, but also the conservation that is activated by his films. This is the driving force behind his work.
                                    
                                　　Filled with startling HD scenes of exotic sea creatures, this is David Hannan's latest underwater masterpiece, a 'state of the art virtual experience' and window onto another world.
                                    
                                　　Many of the sequences have never been filmed before.  Some may never be filmed again.  Corals have survived 5 mass extinctions. But can they survive us?
                                    
                                　　Filmed over 2000 dives on three great coral reef ecosystems; The Great Barrier Reef,  Ningaloo Reef, and Papua New Guinea, Coral Sea Dreaming - Awaken is a celebration of reefs now under threat of climate change and ocean acidification. There is much to be done to safe-guard these precious ecosystems for future generations. And very little time to do it.</简介>
